        <P>&QUOT;If the Lion is the king of the Jungle, How can he be the King of the jungle if he is not the biggiest&quot;</P>

Adult male Lions can weigh up to 250kg and have powerful jaws make them tough hunters and fighters.They are not bigger the Elephet or fastest like cheetah but they have strength and knwolegde to fight againts their prides.<br>Lions live in group called pride. unlike other big cats, they work together to hunt, protect their their territory and take care of their young.This teamwork makes them even more powerful then another animals.
