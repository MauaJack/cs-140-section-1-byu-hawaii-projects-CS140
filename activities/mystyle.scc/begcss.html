        <p style="color:blue;">In the journey of life, each person is endowed with divine potential, and through faith in Jesus Christ, we discover a strength greater than we realize. Often, we face challenges that seem insurmountable, but with trust in Godâ€™s plan, we come to see that we are capable of much more than we first believed. As we seek to follow the teachings of Christ, we find that His grace empowers us to rise above trials and grow into the individuals He knows we can become. Never forget that you are stronger than you think and that with His help, there is no limit to what you can achieve.</p>

            <li>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS. <p>
                Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element, embedded CSS is written within a style tag in the document's head, and external CSS is stored in a separate file linked to the html.</p></li>
            <li>Explain why you should only use external <CSS class="p">
                External CSS should be used because it keeps HTML clean, promotes reusability across multiple pages, and improves website performance by allowing styles to be cached</CSS></li>
            <li>What is a selector used for?<p>A selector in CSS is used to target specific HTML elements in order to apply styles to them.</p></li>
