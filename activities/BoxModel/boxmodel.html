        <ul>
            <li>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?<p>Block tags take up the full width of their container and start on a new line, while inline tags only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.</p></li>
            <li>What is the margin, border, and padding?<p>Margin is the space outside the element, border is the line surrounding the element, and padding is the space between the element's content and its border.</p></li>
            <li>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?<p>In CSS, you can use units like px (pixels), em, rem, % (percentage), vw (viewport width), vh (viewport height), and cm (centimeters).</p></li>
            <li>When would you use a figure tag?<p>You would use a figure tag to group content such as an image and its caption, typically used for media or illustrations.</p></li>
