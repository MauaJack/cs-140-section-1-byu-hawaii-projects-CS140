            <p>A map is a visual representation of an area, typically depicting geographical features, boundaries, and locations. Maps can represent different scales, from a global map showing continents to a local map highlighting streets. They often use symbols, colors, and labels to convey information, such as roads, rivers, landmarks, and political boundaries. Maps can be physical (printed on paper) or digital (viewable on devices), and they are essential tools for navigation, planning, and understanding spatial relationships between places.</p>

           <h2>ENGAGEMENT</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>What is normal flow in HTML?<p>Normal flow in HTML: It's the default layout of elements in a document where they are positioned vertically one after another, based on their order in the markup.</p></li>
            <li>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?<p>It removes an element from the normal flow, allowing other content to wrap around it, typically used for images or layouts.Clearing the float ensures that the container element properly wraps around floated elements, preventing layout issues.</p></li>
            <li>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?<p>absolute positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor, fixed positions it relative to the viewport, and relative positions it relative to its normal position in the flow.</p></li>
            <li>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?<p>Use responsive design with media queries, large touch-friendly buttons, and clear, concise text or icons.            </p></li>
            <li>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?<p>Websites like YouTube, freeCodeCamp, or Codecademy often have videos and tutorials that review HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.</p></li>
